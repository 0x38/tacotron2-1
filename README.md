# Tacotron 2

## Implementation of Tacotron 2

## Initial attempt

This is a tensorflow implementation of [NATURAL TTS SYNTHESIS BY CONDITIONING WAVENET ON MEL SPECTROGRAM
PREDICTIONS](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.05884.pdf).

Initially I will use existing components from tacotron and other opensource implementations

The attention mechanism will not be the same as in the paper (initially)


### Data

LJ Speech Dataset(https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset)

A lot of the base work has been taken from Kubyong Park's (kbpark.linguist@gmail.com) implementation of Deep Voice 3 (https://www.github.com/kyubyong/deepvoice3)
